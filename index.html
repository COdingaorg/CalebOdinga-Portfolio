      <p id="intro">Born in a humble village with less exposure,<i>(Ofcourse i didnt know that back then)</i>I had less interaction with computers, but everytime i laid my hands on one, the owner
      would either complain of me draining out the battery or changing settings to something they never knew existed. All i wanted to do was to figure out how these little things worked. 
    Little did i know just how small i was interacting with this Enormous world of Technology</p>
